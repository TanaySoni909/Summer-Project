# Summer-Project
Hello everyone! This is the coding project that I, and an expansive team of experience developers (5 15 year olds) will be attempting to solve this summer. This is a software built for all users to manage and organise all kinds of tasks and events in a user friendly and simple GUI. Our aim is to help our users maximise productivity with zero costs!
This is our Team:
*Tanay Soni*: Project Manager, Main Coder, Reviewer and Editor
*Ritwik Kumar*: Project Manager, Main Coder and Debugger
*Arpit Verma*: Main Coder, Reviewer and Editor
*Vedant Upadhyay*: Code Tester and Head of the Gooning Department
*Shubh Gordhan*: Lead App and Interface Designer
